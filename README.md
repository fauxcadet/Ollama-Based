# Supported Guardrails

1. No "Financial Advice" Constraint: Strictly prohibit the AI from providing investment recommendations, stock tips, or tax advice; force a redirect to a licensed human advisor for such queries.

2. Competitor Mention Blocking: recognizing and neutralizing queries about competitors, ensuring the system does not promote or discuss rival banks' products.

3. Sentiment-Based Escalation: Automatically transfer the call to a human agent if the customer's sentiment score drops below a specific threshold (detecting anger or distress).

4. Trusted or Allowed Topic list: Restrict the AI's knowledge base strictly to banking domain topics; reject requests to discuss politics, religion, or general trivia.

5. Confidence Thresholding: If the AI’s confidence in an answer is below a set percentage (e.g., 85%), it must fallback to a clarification question or human transfer rather than guessing.

6. Hallucination Grounding Checks: Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a strict "citation" requirement; if the AI cannot find the answer in its approved document store, it must say "I don't know."

7. Toxic Language Filtering: Filter both input and output for profanity, hate speech, or abusive language, issuing a warning or terminating the call if necessary.

8. Transaction Value Limits: Hard-code maximum limits for AI-initiated transactions (e.g., transfers under $500 only); anything above requires human approval or multi-factor authentication.

9. Regulatory Disclaimers: Mandate that the system self-identifies as an artificial intelligence at the start of the interaction and whenever asked, complying with transparency laws.

10. Emergency & Crisis Protocol: If keywords related to self-harm, physical threats, or extreme distress are detected, immediately route to a specialized human team or provide emergency contact numbers.

11. Bias Mitigation Filters: specific checks to ensure responses regarding loans or credit do not vary based on inferred demographics (race, gender, accent) of the caller.

12. Rate Limiting & Anti-Spam: Limit the number of queries or transactions a single caller can perform in a short window to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) or brute-force attacks.

13. Output Conciseness Enforcer: Limit the length of AI responses to prevent rambling; force answers to be brief (e.g., under 30 words) to suit the auditory nature of IVR.

14. Sensitive Action Confirmation: Require an explicit "Yes/No" verbal confirmation from the user before executing any state-changing action (e.g., "Are you sure you want to block this card?").

15. Audit Trail Immutability: rigorous logging of every AI decision and user input in a "Write Once, Read Many" (WORM) format for compliance auditing and forensic analysis.
